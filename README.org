* SiXKCD: XKCD comics in the sixel format

XKCD is great. What's even better is viewing his comics
directly in your terminal using sixel graphics!

To achieve this, you need a terminal that supports it.
Here's a good reference to find one or learn if yours
already does:

** Installation

I'll probably create a =Makefile= in the future
to streamline the process. In the meantime, you
can build the binary in the following way.

#+begin_src sh
# Creating the binary
go get download
go build -o sixkcd ./sixkcd.go
# Installing it on your system
sudo cp sixkcd /usr/local/bin
#+end_src

Uninstalling is as simple as:

#+begin_src sh
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/sixkcd
#+end_src
